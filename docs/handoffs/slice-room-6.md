# Slice ROOM-6.T1: player-socket and two-controller room fixtures

Workbook rules: [slice-workbook-rules.md](slice-workbook-rules.md).

## Scope

- ROOM-6.1: movementRoomFixture offers a player-socket (asPlayer) reactor, proved by a room test that a player socket drives its own Character.
- ROOM-6.9: turnConcentration is proved with two Characters.
- ROOM-6.11: the srdLegendaryAction player-controller and GM-override cases are proved with a two-controller fixture.
- Extend the existing room fixtures (`liveRoomFixture.ts`, `movementRoomFixture.ts`, `actionRoomFixture.ts`); no parallel fixture stack. Keep RELIABILITY-17's fixture isolation guard and `ROOM_REPLY_WAIT`.
- Iterate in CI (`ci/room-6`).
